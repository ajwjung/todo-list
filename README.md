# Todo List

## Objective

To create a browser version of a productivity todo list and to further practice the concepts learned so far. Full details can be found on [The Odin Project's page](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/node-path-javascript-todo-list).

**Requirements**

1. The "todos" should be objects that are created dynamically

2. The todo list should have `projects` or separate lists of `todos`

3. There should be some sort of "default" project to which all of the user's todos are put
    * Users should be able to create new projects and choose which project their todos go into

4. The UI should be able to:
    * View all projects
    * View all todos in each project
    * Expand a single todo to see/edit its details
    * Delete a todo

5. Try to use Web Storage API to store the data so when the user refreshes, the todos don't disappear
